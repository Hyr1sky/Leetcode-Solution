## Problem: Moving Robots

[portal here](https://leetcode.cn/problems/movement-of-robots/)

###  Solution:

**Tag:** `"Riddle" + Sort`

1. Let's reread the description, you will find that the collisions actually do not have any meaning. Robots just keep on their own track because we can consider `switch side` as `switch position of two robots` which literally mean nothing, they just come through each other.
2. So we only need to calculate the final position of each robot and manage the plus operation.
3. **Cautions:** function `%` should be taken in every calculations except addition of `Pos[]`. BTW, please be careful with the `Long Long Type`.

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:

};
```
