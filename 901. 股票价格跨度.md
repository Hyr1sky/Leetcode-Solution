# DAY 22
## Problem: Stock Price Range

[portal here](https://leetcode.cn/problems/online-stock-span/description/)

###  Solution:

1. We only need to return the previous maximum consecutive days, so it comes naturally that we only need to maintain a monotonically increasing sequence.
2. _Solution 1:_ Monotonic Stack
3. _Solution 2: (DNF)_ Two indicators 

### Code:
```c++
class StockSpanner {
public:
    StockSpanner() {
        this->StockList.emplace_front(-1, INT_MAX);
        this->index = -1;
    }
    
    int next(int price) {
        index ++;
        while(price >= StockList.front().second) {
            StockList.pop_front();
        }
        int ans = index - StockList.front().first;
        StockList.emplace_front(index, price);
        return ans;
    }

private:
    std::deque<pair<int, int>> StockList;
    // first: date | second: price
    int index = 0;
};

/**
 * Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * StockSpanner* obj = new StockSpanner();
 * int param_1 = obj->next(price);
 */
```

### Optimization:

We can simply use std:stack to solve instead of deque.\
I was mistakenly using vector and found that `myVector.top()` and `myVector.emplace` does not exist in `std::vector`

### Performance:
`time:` $O(n)$\
`space:` $O(n)$
