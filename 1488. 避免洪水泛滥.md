# DAY 28
## Problem: Avoid flood in the city

[portal here](https://leetcode.cn/problems/avoid-flood-in-the-city/description/)

###  Solution:

**Consider:** HashMap + Binary Search(lower_bound)

1. Observe the hint, we need an `O(n)` search for the recorded raining days.
2. There is no need to process the noRain day immediately, we only need them when there is a coming rain at the same lake.
3. So we record the rain at a certain lake using `unordered_map`, and record the noRain day with `set`. When there is a repeating rain, we search the previous date and try to find whether there is a corresbonding _noRain day_ after it.
4. Then we need to modify the current states of `rain()`, replace the date with current date, and also we delete the record in `noRain` set. 

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> avoidFlood(vector<int>& rains) {
        int n = rains.size();
        vector<int> ans(n, 1);
        unordered_map<int, int> water;
        set<int> noRain;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
            int cnt = rains[i];
            if(cnt == 0) {
                noRain.insert(i);
                continue;
            }
            if(water.count(cnt)) {
                auto it = noRain.lower_bound(water[cnt]); // find the closest raining day
                if(it == noRain.end()) return {}; // can not accomplish the task 
                ans[*it] = cnt; // update noRain tag
                noRain.erase(it);
            }
            water[cnt] = i;
            ans[i] = -1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Optimization:

**Disjoint Set Union:** close to $O(n)$ [portal here](https://leetcode.cn/problems/avoid-flood-in-the-city/solutions/301115/gong-xian-yi-ge-bing-cha-ji-jin-si-onde-si-lu-by-n/)

### Performance:

`Time:` $O(logN)$
