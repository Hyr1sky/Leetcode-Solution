## Problem: Stock Trading (Service Charge)

[portal here](https://leetcode.cn/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

###  Solution:

1. it is natural to consider `Dynamic Programming`, we divide the money into profit and cost, but we will use negetive profit as cost in order to simplify the codes.
2. We define 2 states:
   ```c++
   DP[i][0] //as you are now holding a stock
   DP[i][1] //as you are in normal status
   ```
3. then consider the transfer equation, which is obvious:
   ```c++
   DP[i][0] = max(DP[i - 1][0], DP[i - 1][1] - prices[i]) // buy current stock or keep status
   DP[i][1] = max(DP[i - 1][0] + prices[i] - fee, DP[i - 1][1]) // sell a stock or keep status
   ```
4. return the maximum.

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        int rec_b1 = 0, rec_b2 = 0, pre1 = 0, pre2 = 0;
        pre1 = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            rec_b1 = max(pre2 - prices[i], pre1);
            rec_b2 = max(pre1 + prices[i] - fee, pre2);
            pre1 = rec_b1;
            pre2 = rec_b2;
        }
        return max(rec_b1, rec_b2);
    }
};
```

### Optimization:

consider to use single integer to save the space as we find that we only need to maintain two status: `now` and `pre`.
